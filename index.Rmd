## Replication and psuedo-replication

Trees dataset: 50m from nest trees

Hollow data = 1x nest hole +
              1x rand hole
              
              
              
              
Treelevel data

- nest, health





```{r}
#data
# source(here::here("data/hollow_data_wrangled.xlsx", sheet = 1))


```





## Data and analysis

Catagorical vs continuous

```{r}
#nested trees 
nest <- factor(dat$BirdPresence)
dbh <- as.numeric(dat$treeDiameter)

mod <- lm(nest~dbh)
# anova(summary(mod))



```

Continous vs continous data

```{r}



```
